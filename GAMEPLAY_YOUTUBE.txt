# Outstation_GMS_1.4
Top down shooter developed in Game Maker Studio v1.4X over the course of about half a year. Worked at the time development stopped, but unclear if it actually works right now. Might need some extra lines of code to handle VRAM properly. Folder structure is NOT properly maintained when uploaded to GitHub, hence the scripts are a MESS :P

When it worked: https://youtu.be/eIvsM_l7sc4
